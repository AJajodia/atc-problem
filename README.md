# The Air Traffic Control Problem in Julia

## Problem

Airports around the world serve hundreds of thousands of flights per day. However, delays plague airlines, costing $67.5 billion annually. The Air Traffic Control problem, as described by Dimitris Bertsimas in his classic textbook _Introduction to Linear Optimization_, tries to solve this problem by using linear programming to minimize both ground holding, and even more critically air holding, by airlines.

## Paper

In our paper, we use the popular computational mathmatics programming language Julia to replicate the problem and solve it using the GLPK optimizer. We simulate data using the statistical package R.
